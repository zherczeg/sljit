                     SLJIT - Stack Less JIT Compiler

Purpose:
  A simple machine independent JIT, which suitable for interpreters and
  other dynamic tools. See sljitLir.h for more information.

Compatible:
  Any C (C++) compiler. At least I hope so.

Using sljit:
  Copy sljitLir.c sljitLir.h sljitConfig.h sljitExecAllocator.c and sljitNative*.c
  files into your project. Add sljitLir.c into your project. The other files are
  included by sljitLir.c (when required). Define the machine by SLJIT_CONFIG_*
  selector. See sljitConfig.h for all possible values. For C++ compilers, rename
  sljitLir.c to sljitLir.cpp.
