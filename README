                     SLJIT - Stack Less JIT Compiler

Purpose:
  A simple machine independent JIT, which suitable for interpreters and
  other dynamic tools. See sljitLir.h for more information.

Compatible:
  Any C (C++) compiler. At least I hope so.

Using sljit:
  Copy sljitLir.c sljitLir.h and sljitNative*.c files into your project.
  Add sljitLir.c into your project. The other files are included by sljitLir.c
  (if required). Define the machine by SLJIT_CONFIG_* selector. See sljitLir.h
  for all possible values.
