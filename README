                     SLJIT - Stack Less JIT Compiler

Purpose:
  A simple, machine independent JIT compiler, which suitable for
  translating interpreted byte code to machine code. The sljitLir.h
  describes the LIR (low-level intermediate representation) of SLJIT.

Compatible:
  Any C (C++) compiler. At least I hope so.

Using sljit:
  Copy the content of sljit_src directory into your project source directory.
  Add sljitLir.c source file to your build environment. All other files are
  included by sljitLir.c (if required). Define the machine by SLJIT_CONFIG_*
  selector. See sljitConfig.h for all possible values. For C++ compilers,
  rename sljitLir.c to sljitLir.cpp.
