This file is the short summary of the API changes:

01.10.2012 - Non-backward compatible
    Register arguments of operations with SLJIT_INT_OP flag
    must be computed by another operation with SLJIT_INT_OP flag.

01.10.2012 - Backward compatible
    All operations whose support the SLJIT_INT_OP flag, have an
    alternate name now, which includes the SLJIT_INT_OP. These
    names starting with I.

31.09.2012 - Non-backward compatible
    Renaming sljit_w to sljit_sw, sljit_i to sljit_si, sljit_h
    to sljit_sh, and sljit_b to sljit_sb. Reason: their sign
    bit is part of the type now.

20.09.2012 - Non-backward compatible
    Renaming SLJIT_C_FLOAT_NAN to SLJIT_C_FLOAT_UNORDERED.
    Reason: all architectures call these unordered comparions.
