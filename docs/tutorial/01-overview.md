To be able to follow this tutorial, you will need:
- A `C99` compatible C/C++ compiler (somewhat recent versions of GCC / Clang / MSVC are safe choices)
- GNU Make (or CMake, if you are on Windows)

The examples shown in the tutorial can be built via the `examples` make target. See the [setup guide](/docs/general/getting-started/setup) for more details.

The tutorial assumes you are already familiar with the C programming language.
